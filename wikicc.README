I wrote this script to automate downloading, processing and importing all Wikipedia articles. 


Their methods may have (probably did) changed since I wrote this. It has served as an example
when I need documentation when working with Bash and as a way to track my progress. This was
my first script that contained more than three lines!

Maybe it will help someone else who is looking to automate a download and import process?
